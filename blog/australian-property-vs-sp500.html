    <h1>Australian Property vs. S&P 500 (1990â€“2024): A Comparative Analysis</h1>
    <p>Australian property and the S&P 500 (in AUD) represent two of the most popular investment options for wealth creation. This article compares their performance over the past three decades (1990â€“2024), analyzing returns, risks, and key drivers like interest rates, migration, and wage growth. Whether you're an investor, homeowner, or policy enthusiast, understanding these trends can inform better financial decisions.</p>

    <h2>1. Housing Price Growth vs. Wage Growth (1990â€“2024)</h2>

    </figure>
    <p>Over the past three decades, Australian housing prices have significantly outpaced wage growth. House prices have averaged an annual growth rate of approximately 6%, while wages have grown at a modest 3% per year. However, housing prices exhibit much higher volatility, with sharp spikes during boom periods (e.g., early 2000s, post-COVID recovery) and occasional corrections.</p>

    <h2>2. Long-Term Indexed Growth from 1975â€“2025</h2>

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Indexed Median House Price vs. Wage Growth since 1975. <em>Source: ABS</em>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Taking a broader view from 1975, house prices have skyrocketed nearly 48-fold, while wages have only increased around 10-fold. This indexed comparison reinforces how housing has consistently outpaced income growth over nearly five decades. The growing gap between housing prices and wages has strained affordability, particularly for younger Australians.</p>

    <h2>3. Interest Rates and Housing Price Growth (1975â€“2024)</h2>

    </figure>
    <p>Low interest rates have been a critical driver of Australian property price growth. From 2000 to 2024, periods of declining RBA cash rates (e.g., post-GFC and post-COVID) coincided with surges in housing prices. Cheap credit increased borrowing capacity, enabling buyers to bid up prices without corresponding income growth. Rising rates since 2022 have started to moderate growth.</p>

    <h2>4. Net Migration and Housing Supply (2000â€“2024)</h2>
    <figure>

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Net Overseas Migration compared to Dwellings Completed (2000â€“2024). <em>Source: ABS</em>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Australiaâ€™s population growth, driven by net migration, has consistently outpaced dwelling construction, creating a persistent supply-demand imbalance. Post-COVID immigration surges (2022â€“2024) have intensified this gap, particularly in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, where demand for housing has supported elevated prices.</p>

    <h2>5. Comparing Property and Shares (AUD)</h2>
    <figure>

      <figcaption><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Indexed Growth: Australian Median House Prices vs S&P 500 (in AUD). <em>Source: ABS, Yahoo Finance</em>.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When adjusted to Australian dollars, the S&P 500 has delivered stronger total returns than Australian property over the 34-year period, averaging around 8â€“10% annually compared to propertyâ€™s 6%. However, the S&P 500 comes with higher volatility, experiencing larger drawdowns during market crashes. Property has shown more stability but with lower liquidity and higher entry barriers.</p>

    <h2>6. Final Observations: Property vs Shares</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Returns:</strong> S&P 500 outperforms property in total returns but with greater volatility.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Property offers lower volatility but higher entry costs and illiquidity.</li>
      <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> Property prices are influenced by interest rates and migration. The S&P 500 tracks global economic trends.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Property requires significant capital; S&P 500 exposure is accessible via ETFs or index funds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Conclusion: Which Is Better?</h2>
    <p>The choice between Australian property and the S&P 500 depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Australian Property:</strong> Ideal for those seeking stability, tangible assets, and long-term growth, but it requires significant capital and is sensitive to interest rate changes and migration trends.</li>
      <li><strong>S&P 500:</strong> Suited for investors prioritizing higher returns and liquidity, who can tolerate market volatility and currency risk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Diversifying across both asset classes may offer the best long-term outcome. For deeper insights or tailored investment strategies, explore Tepuy Solutions tools or consult a licensed advisor.</p>
