  <h1>50 Years of Australian Property vs S&P 500</h1>
  <p class="post-meta">Published: July 2025 · Tepuy Solutions Research</p>

  <p>Should Australians invest in real estate or global shares? We've analysed more than 50 years of data to answer that question. From property prices and wages to immigration and interest rates, this deep dive reveals the trends behind the headlines.</p>

  <h2>Property Prices vs Wage Growth</h2>
  <p>One of the clearest imbalances in Australia’s economy is between housing prices and wages. While wages have typically grown around <strong>2–3% per year</strong>, property prices have climbed at a much faster pace.</p>

  <p>According to CoreLogic, national dwelling values have increased by around <strong>382%</strong> since 1992, averaging <strong>5.4% annually</strong>. Some sources suggest growth for standalone houses has been closer to <strong>6.8% per year</strong> over the past 25 years.</p>

  <p class="caption">Annual change in housing prices vs wages. Housing growth is volatile; wage growth is steady but slow.</p>

  <h2>Migration Pressure vs Housing Supply</h2>
  <p>Demand for housing is not driven by investors alone. Net overseas migration, particularly since the early 2000s, has surged. When dwelling construction fails to keep up, prices climb.</p>

  <p class="caption">Population growth has consistently outpaced new housing supply in Australia.</p>

  <h2>Interest Rates and Property Cycles</h2>
  <p>Low interest rates reduce mortgage repayments and boost borrowing power—often pushing up property prices. The chart below shows how interest rates influence price cycles.</p>

  <p class="caption">Falling interest rates have historically triggered property price booms.</p>

  <h2>S&P 500 in AUD vs Australian Property</h2>
  <p>When measured in Australian dollars and accounting for dividends, the S&P 500 has outperformed property over long timeframes. The key differences are <strong>volatility</strong>, <strong>tax treatment</strong>, and <strong>cash flow profile</strong>.</p>

  <p class="caption">Over 30+ years, the S&P 500 (with dividends reinvested) has delivered strong returns—especially in AUD terms.</p>

  <h2>Risks and Tax Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Property:</strong> High transaction costs, leverage risk, illiquidity, exposure to local market cycles, and maintenance obligations. Negative gearing can help with tax but relies on ongoing capital growth.</li>
    <li><strong>S&P 500:</strong> Global diversification, highly liquid, dividend income, and lower fees—but with greater volatility and currency risk. Foreign investment tax rules also apply.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both investments carry risk and rewards. Tax outcomes vary significantly based on structure (individual, trust, SMSF, etc.).</p>
