  <h1>50 Years of Australian Property vs S&P 500</h1>
  <p class="post-meta">Published: July 2025 · Tepuy Solutions Research</p>

  <p>Australian investors have long debated between putting their money into real estate or the share market. But what does the data actually show over the long run? We’ve compiled five decades of statistics and transformed them into clear visuals so you can make more informed decisions.</p>

  <h2>Real Wages vs Property Prices</h2>
  <p>While property prices have risen sharply, wage growth has struggled to keep pace. The following chart compares average full-time earnings in Australia to median house prices from the 1970s to 2025.</p>

  <h2>Immigration vs Housing Supply</h2>
  <p>Net migration into Australia has been a major factor in housing demand. When supply fails to meet the pace of arrivals, prices rise. Here's how immigration stacks up against new dwelling completions:</p>

  <h2>Interest Rates and Property Cycles</h2>
  <p>Interest rates play a central role in determining borrowing capacity and asset prices. This chart shows the inverse relationship between rates and property growth phases.</p>

  <h2>S&P 500 in AUD vs Property Returns</h2>
  <p>When currency and dividends are accounted for, the S&P 500 has outperformed Australian property over long timeframes. But volatility and tax treatment differ greatly.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>While property remains a cornerstone for many Australians, data suggests that diversified exposure to global equities—particularly the S&P 500—can offer superior long-term returns. The choice depends on your goals, risk profile, and timeframe.</p>
