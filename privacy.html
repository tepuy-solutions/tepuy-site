    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: July 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Tepuy Solutions</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988.</p>

    <h2>What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your email address (if you sign up for updates, submit a form, or make a purchase)</li>
      <li>Anonymous usage data (e.g., through cookies and analytics tools)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use it</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate and improve our calculators and services</li>
      <li>To communicate with you (e.g., updates, offers, or support, if you’ve opted in)</li>
      <li>To better understand how people use our website</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No sale or sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties, except as required to operate our services (e.g., Stripe for payments, Google Analytics, or Google Forms for contact submissions).</p>

    <h2>Marketing and communication</h2>
    <p>We will only send you promotional or update emails if you have explicitly opted in. You may unsubscribe at any time via the link in the email or by contacting us directly.</p>

    <h2>Third-party tools</h2>
    <p>We may use trusted tools such as Google Analytics, Stripe, and Google Forms. These third parties may collect data according to their own privacy policies, which we recommend reviewing. We only allow access to the minimal data necessary for service delivery.</p>

    <h2>Data security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information using modern security practices. However, no system is 100% secure, and you should be aware that any data shared over the internet carries some risk.</p>

    <h2>Access and deletion requests</h2>
    <p>You may request access to your personal data or request its deletion by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@tepuysolutions.com">info@tepuysolutions.com</a>. We will respond within 30 days and confirm what data we hold, if any, and fulfill your request wherever possible.</p>

    <h2>International users</h2>
    <p>While we primarily serve users in Australia, international visitors should note that their data may be processed in accordance with Australian privacy laws.</p>

    <h2>Policy updates</h2>
    <p>This policy may be updated from time to time. Any significant changes will be reflected on this page. We recommend checking back periodically to stay informed.</p>
